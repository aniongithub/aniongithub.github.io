I'm a futurist who believes that science and technology are the answers to all of mankind's woes and I want to do my small part to make the world a better place. While I specialize in high-performance compute, graphics/rendering, I've been gravitating towards research in all fields related to computers (which, these, days is _everything_).

**nemo hominem est qui mundum non reddat meliorem**

In Latin, this means "What person is a person who does not make the world a better place?". This is my motto and drives the core of what I am, and what I do. Most people have hobbies apart from the work they do. To me, research and development is my hobby. I've dedicated my life to creating devices, tools and technologies that make the world a better place.
